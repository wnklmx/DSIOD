# Emergency Braking

## Functional Scenario
An automated vehicle follows another vehicle (co) on a straight road. Suddenly, the co carries out an emergency braking maneuver.
## Logical Scenario
In this scenario, both vehicles are in the same lane of a straight road. It is the task of the following vehicle (ego) to avoid a collision with the vehicle in front (co) using Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as well as Automated Emergency Braking (AEB) functions. Initially, the vehicle in front moves with a velocity v_co, the following vehicle moves with a speed v_ego, and there is a time gap of d_t between the vehicles. The vehicle in front immediately starts to brake with a deceleration of a_co until it reaches a speed of v_co_min_frac * v_co.
The scenario is illustrated below:

## Concrete Scenarios
Both datasets contain concrete scenarios which are evenly distributed within the input space defined over the inputs. The train_validation dataset is generated based on the Sobol sequence, the test dataset is generated based on pseudo-random numbers generated by numpy.
