title: "Following"

introduction: ""

functional_scenario: "An automated vehicle follows another vehicle, which initially accelerates, holds its velocity and then brakes."

logical_scenario: "Both vehicles start from standstill. At an initial distance of d_0, the front vehicle accelerates with a_co_1 until it reaches a speed of v_co_max, which it holds for t_v_co_max. Then it decelerates with a_co_2 until it comes to a stop. The following vehicle should keep a small distance (e.g. to increase the traffic flow) while avoiding collisions. For the following vehicle, 8 different function and vehicle model parameters are varied."

concrete_scenarios: "Both datasets contain concrete scenarios which are evenly distributed within the input space defined over the inputs. The train_validation dataset is generated based on the Sobol sequence, the test dataset is generated based on pseudo-random numbers generated by numpy."
